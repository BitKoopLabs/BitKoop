## BitKoop Validator Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up a BitKoop validator node.

Note: For subnet registration and system overview, see the main README.

## üü¢ Quick Start: Remote Docker Compose Setup

1. Create a new directory for the validator and enter it:

   ```sh
   mkdir BitKoop
   cd BitKoop
   ```

2. Download the latest `docker-compose.yml` from the official repository:

   ```sh
   curl -L -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitKoopLabs/BitKoop/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

3. Start the validator (and watchtower) in the background:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: By default, the validator will use the wallet name `default` and hotkey `default`. It is strongly recommended to set your own wallet name and hotkey for security and proper operation. See Wallet Customization below for instructions.

   Tip: You can customize the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable, either in your `.env` file or directly when starting Docker Compose:

   ```sh
   PORT=9000 docker compose up -d
   ```

   Or edit the `PORT` value in your `.env` file. This is the recommended way to change the port (default is `8000`).

4. Post your external IP and port to the chain (required for network participation):

   ```sh
   docker compose exec bitkoop-validator fiber-post-ip \
     --netuid <NETUID> \
     --external_ip <YOUR_IP> \
     --external_port <YOUR_PORT>
   ```

   - See the Fiber Post IP to Chain documentation for more details and command options: `https://fiber.sn19.ai/how-it-works/post-ip-to-chain/`.
   - Make sure the port you specify is open and forwarded to your machine if behind NAT/firewall.

5. Check if it's running:

   Use the following command to check a simple info endpoint from your VPS (replace `$PORT` with your configured port if different):

   ```sh
   curl http://localhost:${PORT:-8000}/info/sync
   ```

   You should see a JSON response containing fields like `progress` and `last_result`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- **Minimum**: 2 vCPU, 2‚Äì4 GB RAM
- **Recommended**: 8+ vCPU, 8‚Äì16 GB RAM

These values account for asyncio.gather-based concurrency, the Fiber framework overhead, and periodic headless Firefox sessions. For future multi-browser validation, plan for 8+ vCPU and 8‚Äì16 GB RAM.

## üõë Alternative: Running Locally (Not Recommended)

- The recommended way to run the validator is with Docker Compose.
- Running locally is only for advanced users who need to run outside Docker.
- There is no autoupdate support when running locally.

If you still want to run locally:

1. Clone the repository and set up your environment:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/BitKoopLabs/BitKoop.git
   cd BitKoop
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install .
   ```

2. Create your environment file:

   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   # then edit .env to set WALLET_NAME, WALLET_HOTKEY, and other variables
   ```

3. Run database migrations and start the API:

   ```sh
   alembic upgrade head
   uvicorn subnet_validator.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}
   ```

4. (Optional) Start background tasks in a separate process or terminal:

   ```sh
   python -m subnet_validator.tasks.run_tasks
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Wallet Customization

You must set your Bittensor wallet name and hotkey for the validator to function correctly. There are two recommended ways to do this:

### 1. Using a `.env` File (Recommended)

1. Copy the example environment file and rename it:

   ```sh
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Open `.env` in your editor and fill in your wallet details:

   ```env
   WALLET_NAME=my_wallet
   WALLET_HOTKEY=my_hotkey
   # You can add other variables as needed
   ```

3. Start Docker Compose as usual:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The validator will automatically use the values from your `.env` file.

See the `env.example` file for all available variables you can set.

### 2. Overriding via Command Line

You can also override these variables directly when starting Docker Compose:

```sh
WALLET_NAME=my_wallet WALLET_HOTKEY=my_hotkey docker compose up -d
```

Replace `my_wallet` and `my_hotkey` with your actual wallet name and hotkey.

## Proxy Setup for Validator

Your validator can work without a proxy, but it is strongly recommended to use one. Without a proxy, the websites your validator processes will often block requests due to repeated traffic from the same IP address. This can significantly reduce your validator‚Äôs efficiency and performance.

To prevent blocking, you should use residential proxies, preferably dynamic (rotating) ones. With dynamic proxies, the IP address changes on every request, which makes your validator appear as a normal user rather than automated traffic.

A trusted service for residential proxies is [Proxy-Seller.io](https://proxy-seller.io). After purchasing, you will receive the following credentials:

- `PROXY_SERVER` ‚Äì the proxy host and port (e.g., us-residential.proxy-seller.io:12345)
- `PROXY_USERNAME` ‚Äì your proxy login username
- `PROXY_PASSWORD` ‚Äì your proxy login password

You will need to add these values to your validator‚Äôs configuration. The recommended way is to set them in your `.env` file (see [`env.example`](../env.example)) so `docker-compose.yml` picks them up automatically:

```env
# .env
PROXY_SERVER=us-residential.proxy-seller.io:12345
PROXY_USERNAME=your_username
PROXY_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Once configured, your validator will route all traffic through the proxy, reducing the risk of blocks and ensuring smooth, uninterrupted operation.

## Configuration

Most settings can be changed via environment variables used by `docker-compose.yml`:

- `PORT`: API port (default `8000`)
- `WALLET_NAME`, `WALLET_HOTKEY`, `WALLET_PATH`: Your Bittensor wallet info
- `SUBTENSOR_NETWORK`: Bittensor network (e.g., `finney`)
- `PROXY_SERVER`, `PROXY_USERNAME`, `PROXY_PASSWORD`: Optional proxy for validation tasks

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- (Advanced) Python 3.9+ if running without Docker
